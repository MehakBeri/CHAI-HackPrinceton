        h2 HOW IT WORKS (Domain Name: "Critique Over Chai")
        h4 CHAI extracts features using Natural Language Processing. Training Data has essay id, essay set, essay, score. The features were extracted using Natural Language Processing and then a Linear Regression model was run so as to predict the score values of ungraded essays. The efficiency of the model was calculated using Mean Square Error value. The efficiency was found to be nearly 70%. I added the following features to each data tuple, after natural language processing:
        ul
          li Semantic coherence percentage - remove unnecessary words by removing all stop words- calculate percentage of important words out of total tokens present in the essay
          li Bag of Words- Bigram Model
          li Grammar - use language_check library- the lesser number of matches, the more perfect grammar the has  been used. So this parameter should have a negative weight assigned to it
          li Similarity measure - similarity between prompt words and essay non-stop words-using princeton's wordnet. The prompt for this dataset was "Laughter"
          li Number of Words: The ideal length of the essay should be 150-550 words
        br
        br
        h2 FUTURE WORK
        ul
          li Introduce clustering using latent semantic analysis as a feature
          li Introduce Plagiarism as a feature with negative weight
          li Introduce BLOCKCHAIN to introduce manual checking and opinion while weighing the score of a given essay. In order to enable human checking, add a reward/token on the chain per essay!
          li Can improve efficiency of the machine learning model using other machine learning models like Neural Networks, SVMs etc.
